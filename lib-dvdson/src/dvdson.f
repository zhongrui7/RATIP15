*
*	DVDSON is a Fortran77 program that finds a few selected 
*	eigenvalues and their eigenvectors at either end of spectrum of 
*	a large, symmetric (and usually sparse) matrix, denoted as A. 
*	The matrix A is only referenced indirectly through the user 
*	supplied routine OP which implements a block matrix-vector 
*	operation(see below). Either the range of the eigenvalues wanted
*	or an array of the indices of selected ones can be specified. 
*	DVDSON is a front-end routine for setting up arrays, and initial
*	guess (calling SETUP). It also performs detailed error checking.
*	DVDRVR is the driver routine that implements a version of the 
*	Davidson algorithm. The characteristics of this version are:
*	 o  All arrays used by the program are stored in MEMORY.
*   	 o  BLOCK method (many vectors may be targeted per iteration.)
* 	 o  Eigenvectors are targeted in an optimum way without
*	    the need to compute all unconverged residuals,
*	 o  It REORTHOGONILIZES the basis in case of orthogonality loss.
*	 o  Finds HIGHEST eigenpairs by using the negative of the A.
*	 o  Finds SELECTED eigenpairs specified by the user.
*	 o  It accepts INITIAL eigenvector ESTIMATES or it can 
*	    CREATE INITIAL ESTIMATES from the diagonal elements.
*	 o  It uses a USER SUPPLIED block matrix-vector operation, OP.
*	    Depending on the implementation, OP can operate in either
*	    memory or on disc, and for either sparse or dense matrix.
*	 o  The user can provide STOPPING CRITERIA for eigenvalues, 
*	    and residuals. The user can also CONTROL reorthogonalization
*	     and block size.
*	 o  On exit INFORMATION is given about the convergence status 
*	    of eigenpairs and the number of loops and OP operations.
*
*	The program consists of the following routines:
*	DVDSON, SETUP, DVDRVR, ADDABS, TSTSEL, 
*	MULTBC, OVFLOW,	NEWVEC, ORTHNRM.

* 	It also calls some basic BLAS routines:
*	DCOPY, DSCAL, DDOT, DAXPY, IDAMAX, DGEMV, DINIT

*	For solving the small eigenproblem, the routine DSPEVX from 
*	LAPACK is used. DSPEVX is obtainable from NETLIB, together 
*	with a series of subroutines that it calls.
*
*	All the routines have IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION(A-H,O-Z)

*  (Important to the following is the concept of NUME, the distance of
*   the index of the eigenpair wanted which is farthest from the 
*   extremes,i.e.,
*      if  lowest  eigepairs i1<i2<...<ik are wanted, NUME=ik
*      if highest eigenpairs i1<i2<...<ik are wanted, NUME=N-i1+1
*   where i1,...,ik are the indices of the wanted eigenpairs.
*   Obviously, NUME.GE.(No. of EiGenpairs wanted). )

*   on entry
*   -------
*   OP		User supplied routine with calling sequence OP(N,M,B,C).
*		B and C are N x M matrices and C stores the result AxB.
*		It should be declared external in the main program.
*   N           Order of the matrix.
*   LIM 	The upper limit on the dimension of the expanding basis.
*		NUME.LT.LIM.LE.N must hold. The case LIM=NUME is allowed
*		only for LIM=NUME=N. The choice of LIM depends on the 
*		available workspace (see below). If the space is 
*		available it is preferable to have a large LIM, but not
*		larger than NUME$+$40.
*   DIAG	Array of size N with the diagonal elements of the 
*		matrix A.
*   ILOW	The index of the lowest eigepair to be computed. If 
*		(ILOW.LE.0).or.(ILOW.GT.N), the selected eigenpairs 
*		to be computed should be contained in array ISELEC.
*		(Modified on exit).
*   IHIGH 	The index of the highest eigenpair to be computed. 
*		Considered ONLY when ILOW is in the range 
*		(0.LT.ILOW.LE.N). (Modified on exit).
*   ISELEC	Array of size LIM holding the user specified indices
*		for the eigenpairs to be computed. Considered only when
*		(ILOW.LE.0).or.(ILOW.GT.N). The indices are read from 
*		the first position until a non positive integer is met.
*		   Example: if N=500, ILOW=0, and ISELEC(1)=495, 
*		   ISELEC(2)=497, ISELEC(3)=-1, the program will find 
*		   2 of the highest eigenpairs, pairs 495 and 497.
*		Any order of indices is acceptable (Modified on exit).
*   NIV		Number of Initial Vector estimates provided by the user.
*		If NIV is in the range:  (NUME).LE.(NIV).LE.(LIM),
*		the first NIV columns of size N of WORK should contain
*		the estimates (see below). In all other cases of NIV,
*		the program generates initial estimates.
*   MBLOCK	Number of vectors to be targeted in each iteration. 
*		1.LE.MBLOCK.LE.(No. EiGenpairs wanted) should hold.
*		Large block size reduces the number of iterations
*		(matrix acceses) but increases the matrix-vector
*		multiplies. It should be used when the matrix accese
*		is expensive (disc, recomputed or distributed).
*   CRITE	Convergence threshold for eigenvalues. 
*		If ABS(EIGVAL-VALOLD) is less than CRITE for all wanted
*		eigenvalues, convergence is signaled.
*   CRITR	Convergence threshold for residual vector norms. If 
*		all the residual norms ||Ax_i-l_ix_i|| of the targeted
*		x_i are less than CRITR convergence is signaled.
*		If ANY of the criteria are satisfied the algorithm stops
*   ORTHO 	The threshold over which loss of orthogonality is 
*		assumed. Usually ORTHO.LE.CRITR*10 but the process can 
*		be skipped by setting ORTHO to a large number(eg,1.D+3).
*   MAXITER	Upper bound on the number of iterations of the 
*		algorithm. When MAXITER is exceeded the algorithm stops.
*		A typical MAXITER can be MAX(200,NUME*40), but it can 
*		be increased as needed.
*   WORK	Real array of size IWRSZ. Used for both input and output
*		If NIV is in ((NUME).LE.(NIV).LE.(LIM)), on input, WORK
*		must have the NIV initial estimates. These NIV N-element
*		vectors start from WORK(1) and continue	one after the 
*		other. They must form an orthonormal basis.
*   IWRSZ	The size of the real workspace. It must be at least as 
*		large as:
*
*		  	2*N*LIM + LIM*LIM + (NUME+10)*LIM + NUME
*
*   IWORK 	Integer work array of size IIWSZ. Used as scrath array
*		for indices and for use in the LAPACK routines.
*   IIWSZ	The size of the integer workspace. It must be at least 
*		as large as:
*			             6*LIM + NUME
*		
*		If LIM or NUME needs to be increased, the space should
*               also be increased accordingly. For given IWRSZ and 
*		IIWSZ one can calculate how big a problem one can 
*		solve (LIM,NUME).
*
*   on exit
*   -------
*   WORK(1) 	The first NUME*N locations contain the approximations to
*		the NUME extreme eigenvectors. If the lowest eigenpairs
*		are required, (HIEND=false), eigenvectors appear in 
*		ascending order, otherwise (HIEND=false), they appear in
*		descending order. If only some are requested, the order
*		is the above one for all the NUME extreme eigenvectors,
*		but convergence has been reached only for the selected 
*		ones. The rest are the current approximations to the 
*		non-selected eigenvectors.
*   WORK(NUME*N+1)
*		The next NUME locations contain the approximations to 
*		the NUME extreme eigenvalues, corresponding to the above
*		NUME eigenvectors. The same ordering and convergence 
*		status applies here as well.
*   WORK(NUME*N+NUME+1)
*		The next NUME locations contain the corresponding values
*		of ABS(EIGVAL-VALOLD) of the NUME above eigenvalues, of
*		the last step of the algorithm.
*   WORK(NUME*N+NUME+NUME+1)
*		The next NUME locations contain the corresponding 
*		residual norms of the NUME above eigenvectors, of the 
*		last step.
*   HIEND	Logical. If .true. on exit the highest eigenpairs are
*		found in descending order. Otherwise, the lowest 
*		eigenpairs are arranged in ascending order.
*   NLOOPS  	The number of iterations it took to reach convergence. 
*		This is also the number of matrix references.
*   NMV		The number of Matrix-vector(M-V) multiplies. Each matrix
*		reference can have up to size(block) M-V multiplies. 
*   IERR	An integer denoting the completions status:
*		IERR = 0 	denotes normal completion.
*		IERR = -k 	denotes error in DSPEVX (k eigenpairs 
*			 	not converged)
*		0<IERR<=2048	denotes some inconsistency as follows:
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR,  2)/1  ) N < LIM
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR,  4)/2  ) LIM < 1
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR,  8)/4  ) ISELEC(1)<1, and no range specified
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR, 16)/8  ) IHIGH > N (in range or ISELEC)
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR, 32)/16 ) IHIGH < ILOW (Invalid range)
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR, 64)/32 ) NEIG >= LIM (Too many wanted)
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR,128)/64 ) Probable duplication in ISELEC
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR,256)/128) NUME >= LIM (max eigen very far)
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR,512)/256) MBLOCK is out of bounds
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR,1024)/512) IWRSZ or IIWSZ is not enough
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR,2048)/1024) Orthogonalization Failed
*	 If (INT( MOD(IERR,4096)/2048) NLOOPS > MAXITER
*	
*		The program will also print an informative message to 
*		the standard output when NIV is not proper but it will
*		continue by picking initial estimates internally.
