 Which units are to be used to enter and to print the energies of the continuum orbitals ?
     A       : Angstrom;
     eV      : electron volts;
     Hartree : Hartree atomic units;
     Hz      : Hertz;
     Kayser  : [cm**(-1)];
 Modify default set-up and printout of the program ?
 Select individual transitions ?
 Assume orthogonality between the orbital sets of the initial and final atomic states ?
  This feature accelerates the computations but also  neglects all relaxation effects
  on the transitions probabilities.
 Calculate all radial integrals only once at the beginning of the computation ?
  This feature accelerates the computations but requires considerable more memory, 
  in particular, if many transitions need to be calculated.
 Enable the restart of the calculation if the run cannot be completed successfully ?
  This feature dumps all necessary information to a restart file from which the calculation can be continued. 
 Sort transitions in ascending order of energy ?
 Read in and apply experimental energies for the calculation of transition probabilities ?
 Einstein A and B coefficients are printed in SI units;
  use Hartree atomic units instead ?
 Print all selected transitions and their energies before the computation starts (this is the default) ?
 Write out the transition energies and amplitudes to an .trn file for further data processing,
  for instance, to adopt them to experimental transition energies ?
 Fix a cutoff criterium other than '10e-8' to neglect small
  admixtures to the computation of transition probabilities ?
 The physical speed of light in atomic units is   137.03598950000000      ;
  revise this value ?
 The default radial grid parameters for this case are:
  rnt =   1.99999999999999991E-006 ;
  h   =   5.00000000000000028E-002 ;

 Less than    9.0000000000000000       matrix elements between final- and initial-state determinants need to be calculated.
  This includes zero contributions due to different M projections in the expansion of the wavefunctions.
